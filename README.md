# Spring Boot Todo Project - React Frontend

> The backend is here: [SpringBootTodoProjectBackend](https://github.com/osmannyildiz/SpringBootTodoProjectBackend)

Welcome! With this Spring Boot Todo Project, my goal is to develop *and deploy* a Spring Boot project on my own. For this, I'll be making a simple web app that consists of:
- a backend API powered by Spring Boot
- a MySQL database
- a web frontend powered by React

I have watched several Spring Boot and React courses, and followed along with their course projects. But for this project, I will be doing that on my own.

See you later! ðŸ˜‰
